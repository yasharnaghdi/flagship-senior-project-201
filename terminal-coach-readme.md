The swimming coach metaphor is used throughout the application:

- **Stroke Efficiency** (Package Management): Just as a swimming coach helps optimize your stroke for efficiency, Terminal Coach helps optimize your system by removing unnecessary packages.

- **Training Plan** (Terminal Navigation): Like a swimming workout plan, Terminal Coach creates a navigation plan with shortcuts and aliases to build muscle memory.
